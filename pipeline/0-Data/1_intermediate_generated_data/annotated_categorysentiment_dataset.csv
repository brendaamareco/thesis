383,Instagra,334157508,CinderellasSong,09.06.2017 00:00,Australia,10.24,1,Advertising online gambling is a no,"Big fan of Instagram. I have been for years. It is my preferred social media platform and my primary creative outlet. 

However, these past weeks I've seen again a flood of advertisements which is annoying. But one particular type has left me asking if I want to abandon using Instagram altogether.

The ad in question is for an online gambling app, it had a prominent Pharoah graphic like a slot machine. 

I just don't even know where to begin with articulating how disturbing this is to me.

As an Instagram user, I trust that when I use your app, it's safe, the community I'm exposed to is a safe and respectful one, and most importantly, it's a place for creative expression, inspiration and many other positive things Instagram has come to symbolise over the years.

Ads.
Online gambling.
To a community whose users may not even be at the legal gambling age.

And for me personally,
as a individual, 
as a corporate professional, 
as a creative user on Instagram,
as a member of a warm and wonderful community of content creators,
My response is a clear and resounding NO.

Online gambling has no place here, real money or otherwise. Not even promoting the behaviour that could prime others to accept it, or to diminish it's potential to devastate people on every level in the name of 'entertainment'.

NO.

Seriously guys, there needs to be a standard. Surely there are limits to what is deemed acceptable and unacceptable, suitable and unsuitable ad that you will accept fees for. Clearer definitions, rules and guidelines on what is okay for Instagram for the sake of it's users, and to protect the Instagram brand by ensuring you associate yourselves with those that align to your brand.

Guys, I implore you - fix this.

Promoting online gambling by way of advertising to line your company's pockets just isn't one of those things you want Instagram to be remembered for.

Please fix it.",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=334157508,39841,3,1,07.08.2017 09:27,-2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NULL,0,NULL,female

 UPDATE TO REVIEW (05/08/17): what happened to the notifications of other Wazers finding road reports helpful? The thumbsup and red ""it's not there"" reporting icons are still there, but I don't receive the notifications in my inbox letting me know other Wazers found my reports helpful. 
 -----
 
 I absolutely love this app. I've used Waze and my Garmin (updated maps) at the same time, and Waze, in my opinion, is much better because I have fellow Wazers out there alerting to road hazards, police sightings, current gas prices, and so forth. Personally, I don't need voice-assisted routing (in most cases); therefore, I mute my Waze app - no alert sounds, etc. Keeping in mind that all apps, programs, etc., have glitches from time to time, I wish reporting incorrect addresses could be done differently and easier. On more than one occasion, I've had Waze direct me to a rural business only to find out that the business is, for example, .5 miles further down the road. 
 
 Not a complaint, but it would be nice if we had more ""moods"" to choose from. Also, I'd like a way to add friends without allowing the app access to Facebook or my contacts. 
 
 Great app though. I use it every day for my commute to and from work - the police trap reports are invaluable to me!!

357,Instagra,506323973,WillBreault,2017-05-09 00:00:00,United States,10.19,5,If only it was its own company!,"Instagram, is an incredible tool that gives more to people's fingertips than they might realize. 
 
 Instagram is owned by Facebook, and in my eyes that deserves one star. I'm not here to bash, but let's be frank, Facebook already has enough money! But really, I'm here to review what I think Instagram could become and what it can do for you already, as well as, provide you with a short synopsis of how it has benefited me.
 
 For starters, I've been using Instagram for nearly 5 months and I have amassed almost 3,000 followers. The reason for this is simply because of the simplicity that Instagram is formed around, post pictures, videos, and watch it grow into something special from all the support. I'm talking about friends who support, strangers who support, and eventually you might just have yourself a very popular account. 
 
 Now, Instagram does have other programs associated with it that help enhance the experience such as, boomerang & layout. These are tools to simply help engage more with the experience and to make it unique.
 
 So why does the title read, ""If only it was its own company"" ? Well the simple fact is, Instagram, in my eyes, could be the single multi media/ social media platform that combines with Snapchat, Facebook, and others to have in one place, rather than 5 or more. 
 
 Social media won't be dying, it has become the new way of life, so let's see what we can do in terms of making our social connections a bit smarter, and compacted for simplicity reasons! The less we have to worry, the better we are as a society.

Why does the interface still look like it was designed on a 16bit computer in 1991?

No smart scrolling
No split view option
No retina quality for ipad users
No quickly available 'deep dig' options for finding FoF 
No info map style smart display to follow who has hearted your pics.
How many clicks to find the # key? Four. Four clicks.
Why just square photos. Even the most basic mobile device in today's world can use apps to take images up to 7mp and edit then to achieve a no quality loss, professional level image

And the keypad!  Even my five year old thinks it's old and horrid and not nice. Was it designed by Mr. Magoo?

A Pinterest style interface and viewing platform would be a huge improvement.

Think about it please. Instagram users are not trying to relive the vibes of the BritPop era.

The biggest advantage is that it has huge database of food so tracking calories is much easier. I've used couple of other apps for diet tracking where I couldn't find many foods so had to create my own foods. Here I didn't have to create my own food. Also has lot of useful blogs. 
One clear disadvantage is that the database for calories burnt by doing exercise is very very poor. I've been exercising for many years and have my own database so I'm using that. But not many people will have that. So the developer must work on this.
Then the calories adjustment for walking, running and stairs climbing doesn't seem to be as good as other apps. 
Further it needs to have data capturing from other fitness apps even from competitor apps.
It would be good have direct link with other social media. Although I don't use it, other users may find it useful.",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=469222161,47819,3,1,03.08.2017 18:55,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,0,NULL,male

I'm thinking that we have grown apart over the years. We have been through lots of ups & downs. Seen memorable events together and shared some life moments. 
But recently you changed. You only wanted to tell me about your ""top stories"", things you thought I wanted to hear- you no longer wanted to share everything with me. 
I want to hear everything like it used to be. Nice and easy. From start to end. 
I fear that if you and I can't  resolve this... It may be the end of our friendship. 
So Facebook, please think about it, I'm not sure if I'm ready to close the book on this part of my life.

It is a tool and is perfect to stay up to date with multiple friends at once. I think the impact Facebook has had on the world is extremely positive.

Exchanging details with people we pass by and communicating, sharing snippets of our lives and thoughts with each other along the journey of life is wonderful. The benefits of having the application on the mobile far outweigh the negatives! 

I believe Facebook has strengthened family bonds globally, giving people the opportunity to share experiences with others is a lovely feeling! Especially for busy entrepreneurs, it encourages family members and friends to show we care even when we are extremely busy!

18,Whatsapp,482577212,Mattie Andie,2017-05-13 00:00:00,South Africa,2.17.22,3,Bug Report,"1) 
 Occasionally in a chat it will suddenly go to a previous message instead of displaying the last message in that chat. 
 
 Example: while typing a message or doing anything in a chat, suddenly it will show a previous message in the chat instead of showing the last message that was sent. 
 
 2) 
 There is still a problem with Voice Notes getting cancelled while recording. 
 
 Example: while recording a VN suddenly after a few seconds it gets cancelled automatically and then an incomplete VN is sent. 
 
 3)
 With regards to improvement it would be nice to hide status updates completely without still seeing a blurred out picture of the status.

 Anyway, really glad to see an app for this course. I don't often leave reviews, but the recent updates just had me scratching my head.
 
 1. Didn't notice the disappearance of the like button. Maybe because I just save everything I like in a board or secret board.
 
 2. I agree with the comments made about not seeing the pinners. Maybe majority of your users enjoy trends and recommendations, but I don't. I I don't follow a lot of Pinners; i follow my friends and other reputable websites. Not seeing who pinned what is annoying and the recommendations and ads are an eyesore. I unclicked the ""picked for you"" in settings because I really don't want to see recommendations , but does that even work or help?

 Another thing, one of my group chats show 2 contacts for the same person when you see the group's info about the participants.
